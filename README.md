Find all flights from one airport to another from historical traffic data
The algorithm is realized for two European airports, with max one connection, with the same company and an acceptable connecting time (1-2h)

Analysis of a reference air traffic file (so6 format) with Python/pandas

The notebook shows (as an example) how to find the connecting flights from Toulouse airport (LFBO) to Vienna airport (LOWW) for a given day (mid-June).
